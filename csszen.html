            <h3>The Rold to Enlightenment</h3>
            <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of brower-speific tags, incompatible 
                <abbr title="Document Object Model">DOM</abbr>s,broken <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">
                    CSS</abbr>support, and abandoned browers.</p>
            <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlighterment has been achieved thanks to the tireless 
                efforts of like the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>,
                <abbr title="Web Standards Project">WaSP</abbr>,and the major browser creators.</p>
            <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. 
                Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating 
                fashion. Become one with the web.</p>

            <h3>So What is This About?</h3>
            <p>There is a continue need to show the power of <abbr title="Cascading Style She">CSS</abbr>.
                The Zen Garden aims in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style sheet into this very 
                page. The <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>remains the same, the only thing 
                that has changed is the external <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>file. Yes, 
                really.</p>
            <p><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>allows complete and total control over the style 
                of a hypertext document. The only way this can be illustrated in a way that gets people excited 
                is by demostrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the hands of those able to 
                creat beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty the web; 
                we can always push it further.</p>

            <h3>Participation</h3>
            <p>Strong visual design has always been our focus.

            <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>.This may seem daunting at first if you &#8217;ve never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and used the sample files as a guide.</p>

            <h3>requirements</h3>
            <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets,levels 1 and 2">
                CSS 1 &amp; 2 </abbr>usage. <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets,level 3 and 4">CSS 3 &amp; 4

                </abbr> should be limited to widely-supported elements only, or strong fallbacks should be 
                provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical <abbr title="Cascding Style Sheets">
                    CSS</abbr>and not latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only 
                    real requirement we have is that your <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>validates.
                </p>
            <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browers have implemented should see fairly 
                consistent result accross most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user agents on the web 
                these days &#8212; especially when you factor in mobile &#8212; pixel-perfect layouts mays not be 
                possible across every platform. That&#8217;s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design 
                should work in at least IE9+ and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browers (run by over 
                90% of the population).</p>

                material to a minium, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. 
                We&#8217;re well past the point needing another garden-related design.</p>
